**Syn** is a Minecraft plugin designed to manage player access to the server.  
Before each new player logs in for the first time, they need to obtain a verification code and enter it in the game to
be added to the allowlist.  
It has a guest mode that allows unverified players to enter the server, except for players on the banlist.

2. Place the plugin file in `plugins` folder of your server
3. Restart your server
